            <p>‡Includes instant cashback and No Cost EMI.</p>
            <p>No Cost EMI is available with the purchase of an eligible product made using qualifying cards on 3-, 6-, 9- or 12-month tenures from most leading card issuers. Eligible AirPods, HomePod and Beats products are available with No Cost EMI on 3- and 6-month tenures only. Monthly pricing is rounded to the nearest rupee. Exact pricing will be provided by your card issuer, subject to your card issuer’s terms and conditions. Minimum order spend applies as per your card issuer’s threshold. No Cost EMI is not available to business customers and cannot be combined with Apple Store for Education or Corporate Employee Purchase Plan pricing. Card eligibility is subject to terms and conditions between you and your card issuer. Offer may be revised or withdrawn at any time without any prior notice. Terms apply.</p>
            <p>Representative example:</p>
            <p>A purchase of ₹79900.00 repaid over 12 months with an interest rate of 15.99% p.a. and No Cost EMI savings of ₹6514.00 requires monthly payments of ₹6658.00. Total amount payable: ₹79900.00.</p>

Instant cashback is available for up to two orders per rolling 90-day period with an eligible card. Card eligibility is subject to terms and conditions between you and your card issuer. Total transaction value is calculated after any trade-in credit or eligible discount is applied. Any subsequent order adjustment(s) or cancellation(s) may result in instant cashback being recalculated, and any refund may be adjusted to account for instant cashback clawback; this may result in no refund being made to you.
